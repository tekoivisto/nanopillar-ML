- calculate_C_cield.py: Calculates local stiffness tensors C(r) based on local lattice orientations and
stiffness coefficients of the cubic crystal.

- grid_search.py: Finds the optimal c11, c12, and c44 values for the undefined voxels using a grid search

- .npz files: Result data from the grid search with different resolutions and averaging methods. Includes optimized c11, c12, and c44 and the predicted Young's moduli with the optizied cij.

Codes for training the CNN to predict Young's moduli and Yield stresses, as well as plotting the predictions and generating Grad-CAM fields.

Training with the "engineered" descriptors (grain boundry atom density, lattice orientation, combintaiton of grain boundary atom density and lattice orientation) was done by running start_run_engineered.sh in a slurm computing cluster. Similarly training with the "raw" descriptor (atom positions) was done by running start_run_raw.sh. Note that prior to training the networks, the descriptors must be generated by running the codes in ../descriptors.

The results for different descriptors and resolutions are stored in folders moduluses_0.0015 and yield_stress_0.005. The large files (CNN weights and Grad-CAM fields) can be found in Zenodo.

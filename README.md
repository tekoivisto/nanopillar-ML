# Predicting mechanical properties of polycrystalline nanopillars by interpretable machine learning

This repository contains the codes used produce the results of the paper 'Predicting mechanical properties of polycrystalline nanopillars by interpretable machine learning'. The contents of the folders are as follows:

- averaging methods: Predicting Young's moduli with the Voigt, Reuss, and Hill averages and the volume integral

- machine_learning: Training the CNN to predict Young's moduli and Yield stresses of the nanopillars and interpreting the predictions with Grad-CAM

- molecular_dynamics: MD simulation codes for generating the dataset

The dataset related code (nanopillars, stress-strain curves, CNN weights, and Grad-CAM fields):
